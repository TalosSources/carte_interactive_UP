    "about-content": "This interactive map aims to bring together existing initiatives in Lausanne that promote and support a circular economy based on exchange and sharing, donation, self-management, and/or enabling a more ecological, social and less expensive lifestyle. <br><br> Additional information is available for each initiative, and it is possible to search for them by their tags. <br><br> The map is developed by the committee of the <a href=\"place.html?id=unipoly\">Unipoly</a> association, and largely takes inspiration from the project <a href=\"https://www.smartakartan.se/\">smartakartan</a>, an interactive map developed in Sweden. Development is ongoing, and new places and other features should arrive soon. We welcome <a href=\"contribute.html\">contributions</a> in the form of suggestions for places to add or improvements to the map itself. <br><br> If you are responsible for an initiative shared on the map and would like it to be modified or removed, or for any other request, you can <a href=\"mailto:carte@unipoly.ch\">contact us</a>.",
